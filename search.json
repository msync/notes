    "text": "Generalization\nThe promise of the neural network is, like the brain, to generalize. That is, to be able to predict the class of a point that it has never seen before. This is the key to the success of neural networks.\nSo, we imagine that the solution is a function that can, given any point in this 2D space, choose a “side.” This side is the class that the point belongs to. So, a curve that can somehow separate the two classes is what we are looking for.\nAs we have stated before (without any formal proof), a network of stacked perceptrons can model any function. So, let’s model this conjectured function with a network of perceptrons."
